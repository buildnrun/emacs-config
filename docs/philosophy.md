# Philosophy of Emacs MyWay

Emacs MyWay is not designed to be cloned once and repeatedly updated; you are not going to see constant updates to the `master` branch.
That does not mean the project is dead!
The whole point is to help you be comfortable with emacs configuration files, so that you can customize your emacs installation to your own whims.
In fact, I would consider it a success if you eventually decided stop using this in favor of your own configuration files.
