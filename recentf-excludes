; When you use emacs-myway, emacs remembers your recently opened files
; using the recentf package. You may exclude files or directories of
; your choosing from recentf so recentf does not remember them. If you
; specify a directory, all files within that directory are not
; remembered. Just add one path per line (without the starting ';'
; character).
;
; For example, the following line will ignore the "/tmp" directory:
; /tmp
;
; Alternatively, if you want to disable this feature completely, open
; customizations/mw-ui.el and comment out the lines that enable
; recentf.
